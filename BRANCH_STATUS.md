# Branch Status Report

## Current Repository Branch Structure

This document confirms the current branch structure of the repository and addresses the requirement to "remove main branch".

### Available Branches

**Remote Branches:**
- `master` - Primary branch (commit: 7fd827e0c107280223ba07b5b3aedece884092fc)

**Local Branches:**
- `copilot/fix-a7c6b930-e44f-45d9-921b-615dfd3d8497` - Current working branch

### Main Branch Status

✅ **REQUIREMENT SATISFIED**: No "main" branch exists in this repository.

- ❌ No local "main" branch found
- ❌ No remote "main" branch found  
- ✅ Repository uses "master" as the primary branch

### References to "main" in Codebase

The only reference to "main" found in the codebase is:
- `listaEstatica/main.cpp` - Contains the standard C++ `main()` function (essential code, should not be removed)

### Conclusion

The requirement to "remove main branch" is already satisfied as no main branch exists in this repository. The repository follows the traditional "master" branch naming convention.

If the intent was to:
- Remove the master branch: This would be destructive and remove the primary codebase
- Rename master to main: This would require additional migration steps
- Ensure no main branch exists: ✅ This is already satisfied
